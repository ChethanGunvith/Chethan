Sealed class

There are numberous techniques out there that helps to manage stage 

what is sealed class ? and where it should be using this ? 
Restricted hierachies
Set
Types
Contain values


Simple eample , it is modeling response from api 

sealed class Result {
  class Success()
  class Failure()
  }
  
  then we can use kotlin when expression : 
  
  when(result) {
    is Result.Success -> 
    is Result.Failure ->
  }
  
  
  when to use Interface and Abstract ?
