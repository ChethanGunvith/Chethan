Hilt Dependency injection library

Dependency injection is a programming pattern.


###Setting up Hilt
To set up Hilt in your app, follow the Gradle Build Setup guide first.After installing all the dependencies and plugins, 
annotate your Application class with @HiltAndroidApp to use Hilt. You donâ€™t need to do anything else or otherwise directly invoke it.

``` Kotlin
@HiltAndroidApp
class App : Application()
```

Defining and injecting dependencies


To make something injectable in Hilt, you must tell Hilt how to create an instance of that thing. These instructions are called bindings.
There are three ways to define a binding in Hilt.
Annotate the constructor with @Inject
Use @Binds in a module
Use @Provides in a module
