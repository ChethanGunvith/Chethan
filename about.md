I am a software geek, working at YACHT/Philips and developing Android and iOS apps is my art. I have 8+ years of experience on mobile application development.

During my career, I have worked at various Android apps. I love the complexity and the forest of options which assist me to build state of the art involves in mobile applications development.

As an Android Developer I strive to keep up with the newest trends and best practices in Android. My goal is to write tested, secure and maintainable code. I have hands-on experience on â€‹Java , Kotlin , Embedded C and Android architectural components.

Learning new programming languages is really interesting to me, outside my work I interested in functional programming, participating in coding competitions and Hackathon.
